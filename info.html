            <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
            <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It executes instructions from programs and processes data to perform tasks. The speed and efficiency of the CPU significantly affect your computer's performance.</p>
            <h3>Types of CPUs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop CPUs: Designed for personal computers, balancing performance and cost.</li>
                <li>Server CPUs: Built for high reliability and multitasking in server environments.</li>
                <li>Mobile CPUs: Optimized for energy efficiency and used in laptops and smartphones.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is a GPU?</h2>
            <p>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) specializes in rendering images, videos, and animations. It's essential for gaming, 3D modeling, and video editing. GPUs can also accelerate other computational tasks like AI and data processing.</p>
            <h3>Types of GPUs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated GPUs: Built into the CPU, suitable for basic tasks like web browsing.</li>
                <li>Dedicated GPUs: Separate hardware for intensive graphic tasks like gaming.</li>
                <li>Workstation GPUs: Designed for professional applications like CAD and 3D rendering.</li>
