            <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
            <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It executes instructions from programs and processes data to perform tasks. The speed and efficiency of the CPU significantly affect your computer's performance.</p>
            <h3>Types of CPUs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop CPUs: Designed for personal computers, balancing performance and cost.</li>
                <li>Server CPUs: Built for high reliability and multitasking in server environments.</li>
                <li>Mobile CPUs: Optimized for energy efficiency and used in laptops and smartphones.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is a GPU?</h2>
            <p>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) specializes in rendering images, videos, and animations. It's essential for gaming, 3D modeling, and video editing. GPUs can also accelerate other computational tasks like AI and data processing.</p>
            <h3>Types of GPUs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated GPUs: Built into the CPU, suitable for basic tasks like web browsing.</li>
                <li>Dedicated GPUs: Separate hardware for intensive graphic tasks like gaming.</li>
                <li>Workstation GPUs: Designed for professional applications like CAD and 3D rendering.</li>

            <h2>What is RAM?</h2>
            <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly. More RAM allows your computer to handle multiple tasks efficiently.</p>
            <h3>Types of RAM:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DDR (Double Data Rate): The standard memory for most PCs.</li>
                <li>SRAM (Static RAM): Used in cache memory for faster data access.</li>
                <li>VRAM (Video RAM): Designed for GPUs to store graphical data.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>AMD CPUs</h3>
                <p>AMD processors are known for their high single-core performance, which is crucial for gaming and applications that rely on fewer cores. They often lead in efficiency and thermal management, making them great for laptops. Their Ryzen series has significantly closed the gap with Intel in gaming performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h3>Intel CPUs</h3>
                <p>Intel processors excel in multi-core performance, offering great value for tasks like video editing, rendering, and multitasking. Intel CPUs are also a good option for gaming, but AMD's "Ryzen" series are ahead currently.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="summary">Both brands have their strengths and weaknesses. AMD is often favored for gaming, while Intel provides more cores for the price, ideal for productivity tasks.</p>
